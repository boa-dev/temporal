# Temporal in Rust

:warning: This crate is highly experimental and NOT stable. We cannot make any guarantee that the API will be stable until `0.1.0`. Do not use in production without extreme caution :warning:

`Temporal` is a calendar and timezone aware date/time library that is currently being designed and proposed as a new
builtin to the `ECMAScript` specification.

This crate is an implementation of `Temporal` in Rust. While initially developed for the `Boa`, the crate has been externalized
as we intended to make an engine agnostic and general usage implementation of `Temporal` and its algorithms.
