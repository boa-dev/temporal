# Contributing to Temporal in Rust

This project is currently highly experimental and fairly volatile. As such, while we do
welcome contributions, we prefer that you open up an issue first beforehand to ensure
the feature is not being actively worked on by a maintainer.

If you're interested in helping out but don't see an issue that's for you, please feel free to contact
us on the `Boa` discord.

## Contributor Information

`Temporal` is a new date/time API that is being developed and proposed for the `ECMAScript`
specification. This library aims to be a `Rust` implementation of that specification.

Due to the current experimental nature of the material and this library, we would advise
potential contributors to familiarize themselves with the Temporal specification.
