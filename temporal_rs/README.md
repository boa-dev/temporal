# Temporal in Rust

`Temporal` is a calendar and timezone aware date/time library that is
currently being designed and proposed as a new builtin to the
`ECMAScript` specification.

This crate is an implementation of `Temporal` in Rust. While initially
developed for `Boa`, the crate has been externalized as we intended to
make an engine agnostic and general usage implementation of `Temporal`
and its algorithms.
